Regression models of categories

grade and how does fav color effect this

\^Yi(grade) = d +b1(blue) + b2(green)

d = refrence

0/1 for both colors

using 2 out of 3 finds out all categoties

Multiple regression has more than 1 predictor(bty and sex)

EX:

```{r}
mod3 <- lm(score ~ bty + sex,
            data = d)
get_regression_table(mod3)
```

This model assumes that the male has a slightly increased bty score

How to draw non parallel lines: actually what it's trying to tell us

scorei = d +b1() + b2() + b3()()

"geom_parallel_slope

```{r}
mod4 <-  lm(score ~ bty + sex + bty:sex,
            data = d)
```

bty:sex means bty depends on sex and makes the lines perpendicular

scorei = 3.95 + .031(beautyi) + -.184(malei) + .080(beautyi x malei)

beauty = whatever score they had

male = 1 female = 0

plug numbers into equations

Her slope .031(b1)

His slope .111 (b1 + b3)
